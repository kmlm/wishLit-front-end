# wishLit Front End

## Summary of Project

I am an avid reader and there are times when I hear about a book or see one advertised and I would like a place to store it. That is why I created wishLit. It is a Single Page Application that allows a user to add specific titles to a wish list with fields of title, author, link to url, and price. A user may not have all of that information, so the only requirement is that a title be entered by a user. The title is then created and assigned to the specific user ID for the user and created in the API as a row in the books table. The title is displayed in the browser using handlebars and a user is able to update or remove each entry in the list. When removing, they are prompted with verification as to whether they would like to delete a book. When editing, they are able to update the fields of the item with the current fields returned to them.

This Readme focuses on the front-end of the project. The back-end API can be found here:
